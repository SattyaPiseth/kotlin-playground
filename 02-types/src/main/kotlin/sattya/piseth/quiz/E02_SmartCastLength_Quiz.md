# E02 — Smart Cast Length — Quiz Me (5 Questions)

1. Why can Kotlin access `length` or `size` without manual casting after an `is` check?
2. When would smart cast fail (for example due to mutability or visibility)?
3. Why are `Collection<*>` and `IntArray` handled separately?
4. What tradeoff exists between returning `NO_LENGTH` and returning `Int?`?
5. How would you extend this function to support `Map<*, *>` safely?
